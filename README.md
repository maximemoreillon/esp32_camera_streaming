# ESP32 Camera streaming

This is basically the CameraWebServer example sketch provided with ESP32 boards in the Arduino environment except that it is stripped down from every feature except video streaming.

With the memory made available from removing the face recongition feature, OTA updates are now possible.

This sketch is intended for ESP32-CAM boards from AI thinker: https://www.seeedstudio.com/ESP32-CAM-Development-Board-with-camer-p-3153.html
